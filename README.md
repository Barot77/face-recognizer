# face-recognizer system

The **Face Recognizer System** is a deep learning-based project designed to detect and recognize human faces in real-time using computer vision techniques. Built using Python and popular libraries such as OpenCV and face-recognition, this system can identify known individuals from a database and mark unknown faces efficiently.

### üîç Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition  
- Easy-to-update known face dataset  
- High accuracy with deep learning models  
- User-friendly interface (CLI/GUI option if applicable)  
- Face encoding and storage for multiple individuals

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- face-recognition (Dlib-based)  
- NumPy  
-  Flask/Tkinter for GUI or Web interface  
  

### üì¶ How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Add known faces to the `dataset/` directory  
4. Run the recognizer:  
   ```bash
   python face_recognizer.py
   ```

### üì∏ Use Cases
- Attendance system  
- Smart surveillance  
- Door lock systems  
- Secure access control
